## characteristics of go
- imported package's function always starts with upper case
- using function inside the same file line starts with lowercase
- golang is annoyed when variable is left unused
- In golang, you should explicitly state types of variable: is it boolean(T/F)?, String? Integer?
- looping in golang is only possible using "for" statement


## abbreviation / vocab for go
- Println: print line
- fmt: format
- defer : when function finishes
- := is letting golang to guess the variable type (boolean / int / string etc)
